# Config Binds for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

+ Fast Equip Binds
+ Fast Buy Binds

- Spamming of binds results in (temporary) kick
- Unable to equip flashes easily in buy zone, if buying wanting to buy only one.

## Default Binds
Often used binds for general gameplay

## Utility Buy and Use Combination keys

By binding a utility key to Use followed by Buy, a single key can be used for both.
Equiping and quick Buying is now even easier. These binds come with one small caveat.
Which is that equiping a piece of util in spawn, might cause an accidental buy, with falshes being the most prevelant.
